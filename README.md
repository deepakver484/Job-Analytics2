**page_link()**

This function collects and returns a list of job links by searching through a list of job listings on a web page. It identifies the job links by locating anchor tags (<a>) within the job listings, extracts the href attribute containing the link, and appends these links to a list. Additionally, it scrolls down the page to load additional job listings and introduces brief delays between each action to ensure smooth execution. Finally, it returns the list of job links found on the page.

**get_links(page_number)**

This function takes an input page_number and collects links from a sequence of pages, starting from the first page and continuing through the specified number of pages. It iterates through these pages by clicking on page number buttons, waiting for page content to load, and then aggregating the links obtained from each page using the page_link function. It prints a message indicating the progress of link extraction on each page. Finally, it returns a consolidated list of links from all the visited pages.

**job_info(link)**

This function takes a link to a job listing page, navigates to that page using a WebDriver, and then scrapes valuable information. It starts by clicking a "See More" button to expand the job listing content. It then attempts to extract details such as the job's location, title, company name, industry, employee count, followers count, job involvement, and more. Additionally, it captures information about the job's description, workplace type, application status, and posting date.
Finally, this function compiles all the extracted information into a dictionary format and returns it. This dictionary includes key-value pairs representing various job-related attributes, making it easy to organize and utilize this data for further analysis or processing.

**job_class(data)**

The job_class function is used to classify job listings within a DataFrame data into different classes based on several features related to job involvement, workplace type, employee count, followers count, and applicants. It performs the following steps:

It selects relevant columns from the DataFrame.
It one-hot encodes categorical variables 'involvement' and 'workplace_type' to convert them into numerical format.
It handles missing values in numerical columns by replacing them with appropriate measures (median or mean).
It applies K-Means clustering with 4 clusters to the prepared data.
It assigns class labels to each job listing based on the cluster they belong to.
It maps the numeric cluster labels to human-readable class names ('Class 1', 'Class 2', 'Class 3', 'Class 4').
It adds a new column 'job_class' to the DataFrame, indicating the class each job listing falls into, and returns the modified DataFrame, which can be used for further analysis or visualization.

**job_job(job_title, df)**

The job_job function takes two parameters: a job title keyword and a DataFrame (df) containing job-related data. It filters the DataFrame to find job listings that contain the specified job title keyword. It then identifies the most common job level, industry, and job class related to that job title within the filtered data. Additionally, it calculates the total number of jobs associated with the job title. The function returns these results as a dictionary, providing insights into the prevalent job characteristics and count for the given job title. If no jobs are found for the specified job title, it returns a placeholder message indicating the absence of job openings with that title. This function is useful for analyzing the job market for a particular job title.

**job_details(job_title, df)**

 The job_details function takes a job title keyword and a DataFrame (df) containing job-related data as input. It filters the DataFrame to find job listings that contain the specified job title keyword. Subsequently, it converts the filtered job data into a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing the details of an individual job listing. These details commonly include information such as job title, company, location, and other pertinent attributes. The function returns this list of job details, offering a convenient means to access and analyze specific job listings associated with the given job title. This function proves valuable for extracting and processing job-specific information for a specific job title of interest.

## Future Scope
The future scope of job analytics is poised for significant growth and innovation. The integration of a fake job removal model and the expansion to include data scraping from multiple job sites are two key developments that will shape the future of this field.

### Fake Job Removal Model:

As job boards and online marketplaces continue to grow, so does the risk of fraudulent job postings. To maintain the integrity of job analytics and provide job seekers with reliable information, the integration of a fake job removal model is essential. Here's how it will contribute to the future of job analytics:

**Enhanced Data Quality:** The removal of fake job listings ensures that job analytics platforms offer accurate and reliable data. This leads to better insights for job seekers and employers alike.

**Trust and Credibility:** Job seekers will trust platforms that actively filter out fake jobs. This will boost user confidence and encourage more people to use job analytics services.

**Improved Matching Algorithms:** Fake job removal will refine the data used for job matching algorithms, leading to better job recommendations for job seekers.

**Fighting Fraud:** Such models will contribute to the broader effort of combating fraudulent job postings, which can have serious consequences for job seekers.

### Scraping from Multiple Sites:

Expanding data sources to include scraping from multiple job sites is another significant step in the future of job analytics. Here are the advantages:

**Comprehensive Insights:** Access to a broader range of job listings from different platforms will provide a more comprehensive view of the job market. This can help job seekers make more informed decisions.

**Diverse Job Opportunities:** Job seekers will benefit from a wider selection of job opportunities, including those that may be exclusive to specific platforms.

**Market Trends:** Gathering data from multiple sources enables the tracking of job market trends more effectively. This data can be invaluable for policymakers, workforce planners, and businesses.

**Competitive Analysis:** Employers can use insights from multiple job sites to gain a competitive advantage in attracting top talent by understanding trends in compensation, benefits, and job demand.

**Geographic Insights:** Scrapping data from various sites can also provide location-specific insights into job markets, helping job seekers find opportunities in their preferred regions.

### Advanced Analytics:

The future of job analytics will also see advancements in data analytics techniques. Machine learning and AI will play a crucial role in predicting job trends, analyzing skill requirements, and providing personalized career advice to job seekers.

### Personalization:

Job analytics will become more personalized, taking into account a user's unique skills, experience, and preferences. This will lead to more accurate job recommendations, reducing the time and effort job seekers need to find the right opportunities.

### Ethical Considerations:

As job analytics continues to grow, there will be increased attention to ethical considerations, including data privacy, bias in algorithms, and fair job matching practices. These issues will shape the way job analytics platforms operate in the future.

In conclusion, the future of job analytics is exciting, with advancements in data quality, data sources, and analytical techniques. The integration of a fake job removal model and data scraping from multiple job sites will be pivotal in providing more reliable, comprehensive, and valuable insights to job seekers and employers alike. However, it's important to navigate these developments ethically and with a strong focus on user trust and data privacy.
